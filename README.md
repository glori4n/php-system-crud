This snippet was made by Â© Glori4n(https://glori4n.com).

A raw user crud made on PHP that applies most of the concepts involved in the standard creation of those, the objective of this project is to just have a basic CRUD system made with PHP, mySQL and HTML.

There is an direct upgrade to this project @ https://github.com/glori4n/php-user-crud.

The SQL file will contain the database as well as user data as props.
